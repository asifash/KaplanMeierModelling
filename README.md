Sandboxing Kaplan Meier

To get kaplanmeier.py editable and working, you will need to install conda or pip at the command line. Then navigate to the folder you downloaded this repo to and enter:

conda create --name <environment_name> --file requirements.txt

I've written the .py file in a notebook style format as I'm using VSCode, so i'd recommend you use that as well.
